# Letterboxd Scraper

A quick little tool to scrape lists of films when given a [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) URL, made to (hopefully) help me with some film data visualizations in the future. It outputs a CSV file with film titles, release year, director, rating, and a link to its Letterboxd page. 

To execute the program, run `python main.py` and paste the URL of your desired list when prompted.
